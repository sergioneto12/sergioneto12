# Hey There, How you doin'?

## This is about what I do...
A Data Scientist and a great Analyst with passion for what all the new oil can bring to us!
I'm currently a Data Consultant at multiple tasks in LATAM operations of Bayer, through the name of Maxxi!

Specialized in solving data problems, you would be surprised about my hard skills, such as:
- Knowledge in languages like: SQL, Python, VBA, Javascript, Java.
- Tools as: Tableau, Power BI, plotting libs in Python, Jupyter Notebook
- Graduated in Math, Concluded MBA in Data Science, I'm currently at my last year to be graduated in Computer Engineering.

Some facts:
- My last task from Math graduation was a prediction of paper waste on schools' classrooms from SÃ£o Paulo.
- Currently I still do not stop to calculate all numbers I see. That's some sort of a good problem.
- I love to chat. Mainly when I can take all info from my stakeholder.
- I learned spanish. Only to talk to my friends in service!
- Machine Learning is more than house prices or titanic predictions. That's for sure!
